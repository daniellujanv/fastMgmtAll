===========

Fast Financial Management FastMgmt will provide a fast way to help the customer keep track of expenses over a short period of time (daily, weekly or monthly). With the development of new forms of payment, like NemPay, and quick checkouts the customer can easily lose track of money spent over a short period of time. With this comes the need for a personal finance manager, but the existing applications need too many clicks or they store more information than you need. FastMgmt is for people that do not care about past or future expenses, the only thing they need is to keep track for a period of time of how much money has been spent without storing personal/sensitive data.
